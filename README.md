# Day-In-a-Life-of-a-Miner

### Description
Using professor Devin Cook from Sacramento State's Assembly library, I created a game that simulated a day in a life of miner, where he/she work during the weekdays and goes out on the weekened, with a chance of getting robbed and killed.
Since it was created under professor Cook's library, it is not possible to view.
